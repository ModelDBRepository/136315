Instructions for running simulations with the set of GP neuron models from
Edgerton JR, Hanson JE, Gunay C, Jaeger D (2010). Dendritic sodium channels 
regulate network integration in globus pallidus neurons: a modeling study. 
J Neurosci 30: 15146-59.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

  common: contains the model description files and some utility functions for
    setting up a simulation.

    common/biophysics: ion channel, synapse and passive biophysics descriptions
    common/morphol: cell morphology descriptions
    common/library: scripts to create a library of template objects during the
        simulation
    common/functions: various implementation scripts for the simulations
    common/comptlists: lists of model compartments for various purposes such
        as where to put synapses, which compartments to save outputs from, etc.

  shellscripts: linux shell scripts to help run the simulations

  run_example: scripts to run two different types of example simulations

    run_example/run_slice.g: example simulations with no synaptic inputs but
        with somatic current injections like those often used in slice
        experiments.

    run_example/run_vivo.g: example simulations with synaptic inputs active
        throughout the dendritic tree. Synapses have random timing in these
        simulations.

  matlab_reader: a plugin written in C that enables you to load the
        output data into Matlab.
        --> compile using the Matlab mex compiler in a Linux shell:
          > mex -output readgenesis readgenesis.c
     

TUTORIAL:

  First, you must have genesis 2.3 installed on your machine.

  Download and unzip the model files. 

  Navigate to the run_example directory.

  To run the "slice" simulations, execute the following commands:

    > ../shellscripts/create_perlhash_param_db pars_slice.par

    > ../shellscripts/runbatch_local_perlhash.sh run_slice_example.g pars_slice.par 1 1

        This command runs a simulation using the first row of parameters listed
            in the pars_slice.par file. If it runs without any problem you
            should see a data file appear in the data_slice directory named
            1_mtype_1_scaleMeth_0_sclTau_-200_pAinjected_slice_example_run_v.bin

    > ../shellscripts/runbatch_local_perlhash.sh run_slice_example.g pars_slice.par 2 72

        This command runs each of the remaining 71 parameter combinations in the
            pars_slice.par file sequentially. Once complete, there should be
            72 data files in the data_slice directory, one for each parameter
            set.


  To run the "vivo" simulations, simply repeat the same steps with the vivo
        example scripts.

    > ../shellscripts/create_perlhash_param_db pars_vivo.par

    > ../shellscripts/runbatch_local_perlhash.sh run_vivo_example.g pars_vivo.par 1 1

    > ../shellscripts/runbatch_local_perlhash.sh run_vivo_example.g pars_vivo.par 2 18


  To visualize the data in Matlab: 
    First compile the reader:
      > mex -output readgenesis readgenesis.c
        
    Add the reader directory to your Matlab path, then run the following
        commands from within Matlab:

    % Load the data into the workspace
    >> tdat = readgenesis('data_slice/1_mtype_1_scaleMeth_0_sclTau_-200_pAinjected_slice_example_run_v.bin', 1);

    % Change the y-scale from volts to millivolts
    >> tdat = tdat .* 1e3;

    % Plot the data
    >> figure; plot([1e-4:1e-4:5], tdat);
